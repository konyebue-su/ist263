    My name is Kelechi Onyebuenyi. I am a senior in the ISchool majoring in Information Management and Technology with an interest in UX Design and web development. I have taken two previous coding courses in SQL and Python so Iâ€™m excited to learn HTML and CSS. I was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY and am from Nigerian descent. In my free time I like to listen to music, watch tv shows, follow streetwear, workout, and play sports/video games.
